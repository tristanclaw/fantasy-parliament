# Fantasy Parliament League Rules

"Your Roster. Their Votes. Our Democracy."

## 1. Roster Management
- **The Core Five:** You draft a team of **5 MPs** total.
- **Team Captain:** Your primary MP. Typically represents your home riding or your favorite politician. Currently, the Captain acts as your standard-bearer.
- **Team Members:** You draft 4 additional MPs to round out your roster.
- **Local-First:** Your team is stored in your browser's local storage. No accounts required.

## 2. Scoring System
MPs earn points based on their real-world activity in the House of Commons:
- **Speeches (+1 pt):** Every time your MP rises to speak or intervenes in a debate.
- **Votes (+2 pts):** For every official vote your MP participates in. Showing up matters!
- **Bill Sponsored (+10 pts):** When your MP introduces or sponsors a bill.
- **The Grand Slam (+50 pts):** When a bill sponsored by your MP receives Royal Assent and becomes law.

*Note: Data is synchronized daily from OpenParliament.ca.*

## 3. Data Retention & Seasonality (The 7-Day Sprint)
- **The 7-Day Rolling Window:** Unlike traditional fantasy sports where scores accumulate for months, Fantasy Parliament uses a **rolling 7-day window**. 
- **What this means for you:** Your total score is a "snapshot" of your team's activity over the last week. If an MP stops showing up or speaking, their points "expire" after 7 days, and your score will drop.
- **Why?** This keeps the game fast-paced and rewards "Political Junkies" who draft MPs that are consistently active in the House. To stay at the top of the leaderboard, you need a team that grinds every single session.

## 4. Leaderboard & Benchmarking
- **Global Leaderboard:** Submit your team's total score to compete against other "Political Junkies" across Canada!
- **Special Teams:** Can your local team outscore the **"Party Leaders"** benchmark? Watch the leaderboard for special curated teams like the "All-Whip Squad" or "The Deputy PM Shadows."
